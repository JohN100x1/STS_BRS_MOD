        Hey do you see this "amount" and "stackAmount" up here^ (press ctrl+p inside the parentheses to see parameters)
        THIS DOES NOT MEAN APPLY 1 POWER 1 TIMES. If you put 2 in both numbers it would apply 2. NOT "2 STACKS, 2 TIMES".

        The stackAmount is for telling ApplyPowerAction what to do if a stack already exists. Which means that it will go
        "ah, I see this power has an ID ("") that matches the power I received. I will therefore instead add the stackAmount value
        to this existing power's amount" (Thank you Johnny)

        Which is why if we want to apply 2 stacks with this card every time, want 2 in both numbers -
        "Always add 2, even if the player already has this power."
